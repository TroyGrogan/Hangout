🚀 Here's The Complete RLS Solution:

The setup_rls_simple.py script will NOT automatically implement RLS on your custom app tables. 

Here's what it actually does:
✅ What setup_rls_simple.py DOES:
Checks for auth functions (which we already set up)
Runs Django migrations (makemigrations and migrate)
Verifies RLS status on a few hardcoded tables

❌ What it DOESN'T do:
Enable RLS on your custom tables
Create RLS policies for your app tables
Set up proper security rules for your models


🎯 Complete Answer:
NO - the setup_rls_simple.py script will NOT automatically implement RLS on your custom app tables. It only runs migrations and checks a few tables.


Step 1: Run Django Migrations First

Bash:
cd backend
cd database_rls_things
python setup_rls_simple.py

This creates your tables but doesn't secure them.


Step 2: Run the Custom App RLS Script

The setup_custom_app_rls.sql script will properly secure ALL your app tables:

Copy the contents of backend/database_rls_things/setup_custom_app_rls.sql
Paste into Supabase SQL Editor (Click the arrow button in the SQL editor, 
then click the Create a new snippet button)

Run the script

🔒 What This Will Secure:
users - Users can view all profiles, only edit their own
user_preferences - Users only access their own preferences
friendships - Users only see/manage their own friendships
events - All can view, only hosts can edit their events
event_attendees - Users manage their own RSVPs
ai_chat_chat - Users only access their own chat sessions

📋 Complete Process:
✅ supabase_rls_fix.sql (Django system tables) - DONE
⏳ setup_rls_simple.py (create tables) - DO THIS
⏳ setup_custom_app_rls.sql (secure app tables) - THEN THIS

This will give complete RLS coverage for the entire application!

You can then run these status check sql scripts in order to see if
The app's database tables had RLS successfully implemented.

So, in short:

Run the Django RLS setup python scripts first:



Perfect! Now let me make the script executable and provide you with the solution:

‼️ chmod +x backend/run_database_setup.py  ‼️

Great! I've created a solution to your connection string problem. Here's what I've done:

The Problem
The shell was interpreting special characters in your Supabase connection string (like @ and !), which caused the "event not found" error.

The Solution
I've created a Python script (run_database_setup.py) that uses your existing Django database configuration instead of trying to use the raw connection string in the shell.

What You Need to Do:
Create a .env file in your backend directory with your database password:
bash
Apply to ENVIRONMENT_...
Run
   # In backend/.env
   DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
   DJANGO_DEBUG=True
   DB_PASSWORD=your-actual-supabase-password
   SUPABASE_URL=https://yvmjkcwcagywdwemfcbq.supabase.co
Get your Supabase password:
Go to your Supabase dashboard
Navigate to Settings > Database
Copy the password and put it in your .env file
Run the setup script:
bash
Apply to ENVIRONMENT_...
Run
   cd backend
   python run_database_setup.py

What the Script Does:
✅ Tests your database connection using Django's configuration
✅ Runs Django migrations to set up your models
✅ Executes your supabase_sql_setup.sql file if it exists
✅ Provides clear error messages if anything goes wrong

This approach is much more reliable than trying to use connection strings directly in the shell, and it leverages your existing Django setup. The script will handle all the connection details safely without shell interpretation issues.Would you like me to help you with anything else once you've set up your .env file and tried running the script?
