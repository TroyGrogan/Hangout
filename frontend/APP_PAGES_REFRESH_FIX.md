âœ… Solution Overview
The app will now:
1. Remember authentication state across page refreshes
2. Restore users to the exact page they were on before refreshing
3. Work for both authenticated and guest users
4. Handle edge cases like direct navigation vs. page refresh

ðŸ”§ What Was Implemented
1. Enhanced Route Capture (main.jsx)
    - Detects when the page loads and captures the initial URL
    - Identifies whether this is a page refresh or first visit
    - Stores this information for the PageStateManager to use
2. Robust Storage System (pageStateUtils.js)
    - Multiple storage layers: sessionStorage for browser navigation, localStorage for persistence
    - Smart restoration logic: Prioritizes the most reliable path source
    - Intelligent decision making: Determines when route restoration should happen
    - Automatic cleanup: Removes stale restoration data
3. Coordinated Authentication (AuthContext.jsx)
    - Added authInitialized flag so PageStateManager knows when auth is ready
    - Maintains all existing authentication functionality
    - Coordinates timing with route restoration
4. Smart Route Manager (PageStateManager.jsx)
- Waits for auth initialization before attempting restoration
- Only attempts restoration once to prevent loops
- Handles different scenarios:
    - Page refresh from specific page â†’ Restore to that page
    - Direct navigation to specific page â†’ Allow normal navigation
    - First visit to home page â†’ Show guest interface
- Automatic cleanup of restoration data

ðŸŽ¯ How It Works Now
Scenario 1: User refreshes on /events/123
1. Browser requests /events/123 from server
2. Server returns index.html (SPA behavior)
3. App captures initial path: /events/123
4. AuthContext initializes user authentication state
5. PageStateManager detects refresh and restores user to /events/123
6. User sees the exact page they were on! âœ…

Scenario 2: User refreshes on /profile
1. Same process, but restores to /profile
2. Works for both authenticated and guest users âœ…

Scenario 3: User visits / directly
1. App shows guest interface as intended
2. No unwanted redirections âœ…

Scenario 4: User opens /calendar in new tab
1. Direct navigation works normally
2. No interference from restoration logic âœ…

ðŸš€ Key Benefits
- âœ… Preserves user experience: No more losing your place on refresh
- âœ… Works universally: Authenticated users, guest users, all pages
- âœ… Handles edge cases: Direct navigation, browser back/forward, etc.
- âœ… Performance optimized: Minimal overhead, smart cleanup
- âœ… Backwards compatible: All existing functionality preserved
